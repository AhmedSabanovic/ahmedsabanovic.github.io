I am a PhD student at **TU Wien** in the **Research Unit of Computational Sustainability**.

My research interests include **data visualization**, **multimodal learning**, and
**energy-efficient machine learning**, with a focus on developing methods that make
complex systems more interpretable, scalable, and sustainable.

I have a strong background in data science and machine learning, and I enjoy working
at the intersection of **research and applied systems**, particularly where visual
analytics can support understanding and decision-making.

Outside of academics, I enjoy cycling, playing basketball, and staying physically active.
