I am a Data Science master’s student with a strong interest in **data visualization,
machine learning, and multimodal systems**.

My work focuses on transforming complex data into **clear, interactive, and
insightful visual representations**, as well as exploring **energy-efficient
approaches to modern machine learning models**. I enjoy working at the intersection
of research and practical applications, especially when visualization plays a
central role in understanding data.

Outside of academics, I enjoy cycling, playing basketball, and staying physically active.
