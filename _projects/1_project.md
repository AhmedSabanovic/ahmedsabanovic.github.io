## Project Overview

**Virtual Shepherd** is a research project focused on satellite-based monitoring,
edge computing, and geospatial AI to support **sustainable livestock grazing**
in the Alpine region.

The system enables *fenceless farming* by guiding cattle using smart collars,
while reducing conflicts between hikers and livestock and improving animal welfare.

## System Architecture

Virtual Shepherd integrates multiple technologies:

- **GNSS** for precise positioning  
- **LoRaWAN** for low-power long-range communication  
- **4G/5G** for high-bandwidth data transfer  
- **Edge Computing** to process data locally  
- **Geospatial AI** for behavior analysis and anomaly detection  

Edge-based processing reduces bandwidth usage and improves system resilience
in challenging alpine environments.
